# 🌍 Language Translation Model

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)** model using a deep learning framework to perform machine translation. The model is trained to translate sentences from one language to another — for example, from **English to French**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Language translation is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this project, a Seq2Seq model with an encoder-decoder architecture was created to learn mappings between source and target languages. The model is trained on paired language datasets and leverages techniques such as:

- Tokenization
- Word embedding
- Teacher forcing
- LSTM/GRU-based encoder-decoder models


## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** or **PyTorch** (depending on implementation)
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization (if applicable)

## 📌 Key Features

- Preprocessing of bilingual sentence pairs
- Vocabulary construction and tokenization
- Encoder-decoder architecture with LSTM/GRU units
- Teacher forcing during training
- Translation inference with greedy decoding

## 📈 Example Output

The model is capable of translating simple English sentences like:
```vbnet
Input: "Hello, how are you?"
Output: "Bonjour, comment ça va ?"
```

## 📚 Future Improvements

- Use attention mechanism (Bahdanau or Luong attention)
- Implement beam search decoding
- Train on larger, more diverse datasets
- Add support for more language pairs
